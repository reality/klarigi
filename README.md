# Klarigi

This application will derive characteristic and discriminatory explanations for groups 
of entities described by ontology classes. For example, groups of
patients described by HPO classes. For more information, please read the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.14.448423v2).
