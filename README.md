# Klarigi

This application will derive characteristic and discriminatory explanations for groups 
of entities described by ontology classes. For example, groups of
patients described by HPO classes. For more information, please read the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.14.448423v5).

## Installation

Here is the most recent [stable release](https://github.com/reality/klarigi/releases/tag/0.1.2). To install, you just have to extract either the ZIP or Tar file, then either run the ```klarigi``` binary from the extracted folder directly, or add it to your PATH (see the later linked tutorial for an example). You can also check out the [snapshot release](https://github.com/reality/klarigi/releases/tag/0.1.3-SNAPSHOT), which includes lots of performance improvements and some bug fixes.

## Guide

This [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qQWqD6gOTieuUwsZSGZLW3-WbsZKyGs4?usp=sharing) will walk you through how to use Klarigi. You can also run ```klarigi -h``` to see a full list of options and parameters.
